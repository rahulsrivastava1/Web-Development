What - It is an open source programming language by Microsoft, which is typed superset of JavaScript. 

Why - Optional static typing and type inference
      It catches specific error at compile time rather than waiting for them to occur at runtime, making it easier to catch and fix them early in deployment.
      IDE support

Compile Typescript file to normal Javascript file for browser using typescript compiler.

Installation - npm install -g typescript

Check version - tsc -v

Automatically compile typescript to javascript command - tsc filename --watch

Variable type declaration - let varname : variabletype = value;

To make optional a parameter in typescript function, we append '?' mark at the end of parameter name.
